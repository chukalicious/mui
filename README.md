# Front End Tutor challenge using Material UI
This is practice with a fresh clean material ui app. 
I've done the basic boiler plating for:
- dependency installation
- the CssBaseline (a type of normalize) "wrapping" the app
- imported Roboto
- wrapped App in ThemeProvider

## Styles

### Main Theme: 
A main theme has been created. So far only the palette variables have been changed. The name of the theme is Main Theme and it's serving at the App.js level.


### ClassNames:
The way individual "classes", if you will, are created as objects in separate style modules that contain the styles to be applied to the component/element via the sx props. Therefore, the syntax for these styles has to be in complience with the sx API.
