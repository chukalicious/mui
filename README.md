# Front End Tutor using Material UI
This is practice with a fresh clean material ui app. 
I've done the basic boiler plating for:
- dependency installation
- the CssBaseline (a type of normalize) "wrapping" the app
- imported Roboto
- wrapped App in ThemeProvider

##Main Theme 
A main theme has been created. So far only the palette variables have been changed. The name of the theme is Main Theme and it's serving at the App.js level.
